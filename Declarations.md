# Mythic Systems - Declarations

This document declares the Mythic Systems vision, mission, philosophy, and code of ethics. 

## About
Mythic Systems is a transdisciplinary education organization producing evolutionary transmedia experiences to actualize human potential for transformation.

## Vision

Being a widely impactful phenomena of social evolution.

## Mission

Helping humanity discover, embody, and fulfill their purpose.   

## Philosophy

The problems leading to global crises today—ecological, sociological, and economic—are rooted in a more fundamental psychological crisis of meaning and perspective.  

We most need a whole and healthy understanding of our collective story (history), a clear, coherent, and cohesive vision of where we are going, and who we are becoming as a collective.  The opportunity now is to engender collective intelligence, and to collectively co-create something like a new mythos.

# Mythic Systems - Roadmap

This document outlines the Mythic Systems project execution plan (it will be updated as progress and pivots are made).

The development of Mythic Systems follows a high level methodology and pathway:

1 - **IDEATION & EXPERIMENTATION** (brainstorm and brainswarm): establish solid conceptual foundations that ensure delivery of a valuable product / service / experience into the social sphere.

2 - **DEVELOPMENT & IMPLEMENTATION** (build and deliver): develop ideas and successful experiments into functional and robust applications that scale, delivering systemic solutions into the real world.

3 - **INNOVATION & OPTIMIZATION**: receive audience feedback (return to Phase 1), test, and continue to develop and innovate the project in potential new directions.

# Mythic Systems - Roadmap

This document outlines the Mythic Systems project execution plan (it will be updated as progress and pivots are made).

The development of Mythic Systems follows a high level methodology and pathway:

1 - **IDEATION & EXPERIMENTATION** (brainstorm and brainswarm): establish solid conceptual foundations that ensure delivery of a valuable product / service / experience into the social sphere.

2 - **DEVELOPMENT & IMPLEMENTATION** (build and deliver): develop ideas and successful experiments into functional and robust applications that scale, delivering systemic solutions into the real world.

3 - **INNOVATION & OPTIMIZATION**: receive audience feedback (return to Phase 1), test, and continue to develop and innovate the project in potential new directions.

## Phase 1: IDEATION and EXPERIMENTATION
### August 2018, on going ...

The primary aim of this initial phase is to establish solid conceptual foundations to ensure delivery of valuable products / services / experiences into the social sphere.  Simple and agile experiments can be conducted to test concepts with real-world audiences, and confirm value creation.   


Goals of this phase are:

1 - Complete a comprehensive overview of the Mythic Systems project:

   - complete [Mythic Systems Declarations](Declarations.md): vision, mission, philosophy, and code of ethics.

   - design a high-level Mythic Systems map of project scope (“Salt Lake City” planning style): (https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1-eDcVt4dnXzU9_YdVJb3hb-FmK3j1p5YLySjJzd3K6M/edit?usp=sharing).

   - define and clarify fundamental problem / solution sets from a “first principles” perspective (https://mayooshin.com/first-principles-thinking).

   - prepare the Mythic Systems brand and website (http://mythicsystems.com) as a portal hub to conduct real-world value experiments, and host project initiatives. 


2 - Outline a “Mythic Systems Lab” list of ideas and protocols for experiments to conduct based on problem / solutions sets.


3 - Conduct small, simple, agile experiments in real world settings, and input the results back into the experimentation process until value clarification is achieved, then evolve successful experiments into project initiatives.

## Phase 2: DEVELOPMENT & IMPLEMENTATION
### TBD, 2019

The primary aim of this phase is to develop ideas and successful experiments into functional and robust applications that scale, delivering systemic solutions into the real world.

Goals in realizing this phase will be defined after a first round of Phase 1 is complete.

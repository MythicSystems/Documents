# Mythic Systems Manifesto (draft)

## Axioms / Principles

1 - **CONSCIOUS EVOLUTION**: 

*“In the midst of chaos, there is also opportunity” ~ Sun-Tzu*

As our world moves thru potent changes, we can recognize that we have a choice in how we participate in navigating and guiding transformation.  We have free will, and can consciously choose how we evolve (or devolve).  By taking responsibility for where we are and looking to where we want to go, we are less likely to arrive somewhere we don’t want to be, and much more likely to arrive to exactly where we do want to be.

2 - **SOVEREIGN INTERDEPENDENCE**:

*sovereign interdependence = autonomous, self-sufficent, and self-governing individuals + collaborative, self-governing collective* (sovereign at both the individual and collective levels)

"The people are the government, administering it by their agents; they are the government, the sovereign power." ~ Andrew Jackson

"I believe that sovereignty is the twin sister of democracy. If there's no sovereignty, there's no democracy." ~ Marine Le Pen

"When we fall in love with a vocation, I call it vocational arousal. It’s a supra-sexual desire to fully express our genius, not to reproduce the species now but to evolve the species. Because the species does not need more and more babies. It needs more and more evolved humans." ~ Barbara Marx Hubbard

"her purpose in life: to be a beacon of hope, to communicate to humanity the story of our evolution and potential." (BMH)

Sovereign (legal). We are our own rulers.  We have the right, privilege, and responsibility to govern and ‘parent’ ourselves.  

Global collective transformation begins at the level of individual transformation.  Like a cell within a body, many healthy cells equate to a healthy whole.  Individuals who are becoming stable and centered in their own sufficiency and purpose establish an optimal basis for synergistic collaboration with each other, thus realzing a thriving, intelligent, interdependent collective together.    


3 - **EMPATHIC CIVILIZATION**

*“The most important question facing humanity is this: Can we reach global empathy in time to avoid the collapse of civilization and save the Earth?” ~ Jeremy Rifkin, The Empathic Civilization: The Race To Global Consciousness In A World In Crisis*

Unity in Diversity.  

Integrate diverse perspectives and value systems. 

Healthy natural ecologies (forests, jungles, oceans) thrive by a diversity of species living in balance.  The same is true for social ecologies where the values and perspectives of many different kinds of people can be regarded with balance in a totality.  

Current systems ingender apathy.  How to create systems that generate empathy?

The sum is greater than the parts.  

"None of us is as smart as all of us. Keeping your ideas to yourself is detrimental. Diversity of people equals diversity of ideas." ~ Denise Jacobs

“We need myths that will identify the individual not with his local group but with the planet.” 
― Joseph Campbell, The Power of Myth

Myths are public dreams, dreams are private myths. - Joseph Campbell

4 - **PERSPECTIVE IS EVERYTHING**: 

*“The universe is made of stories, not of atoms.” ~ Muriel Rukeyser*

"There is no energy crisis, food crisis or environmental crisis. There is only a crisis of ignorance."
~ R. Buckminster Fuller

There is great power in story, myth, and narrative.  Story provides meaningful perspective, helping to understand and settle the past, as well as provide possibility and vision for the future.

Traditionally, myth has has helped humanity understand our world, and supported the evolution of human culture.

Currently, humanity is in a crisis of meaning and perspective.  All ecological and sociological crises are rooted in this crisis of meaning and perspective.  The opportunity now is to collectively co-create a new mythos: a clear and coherent vision of who we are and who we are becoming.  But a new ‘mythos’ will not look like any other type of mythology we have seen before.  Everything in our world and about humanity is about to radically change, and so even our understanding of what a ‘mythos’ is may be very different.
  
- A crisis of meaning due to an imbalance of ‘collective intelligence’ relative to acceleration and potency of evolutionary change.  We need healthy and coherent perspectives of both our past and our future. Stories are wisdom, empathic glue, etc (AQ - aquarian artifact)

- Life and vitality trumps meaning.  Everyone has at least one thing in common: we all want a good experience of being alive.  A myth of living.  A living myth.   


5 - **COLLECTIVE INTELLIGENCE**: 

“Collective Intelligence (CI) is the capacity of human collectives to engage in intellectual cooperation in order to create, innovate, and invent.” ~ Pierre Levy

Today we face global problems of such great scale and complexity that are unprecedented in our our history.  We have never faced problems like this before--problems that breach the comprehension of any single indivudual or small group.  To solve these large problems, we must approach them with a level of intelligence that matches the scale of the issues.  By harnessing Collective Intelligence, we may rise to an order of intelligent organization and scale that can provide global scale solutions. 

Individual transformation combined with organizing many individuals to collaborate at scale = Collective Intelligence.  We need a high order of collective intelligence to solve the very large and complex problems we face (which are normal given the stage of our evolutionary progress).  Empathy / empathic civilization, etc. Neo-democracy.  Economics as a measure of CI.  HI + AI = CI (“Radical Collective Intelligence”). This change is a natural part of an evolving species becoming a super-orgamism.  


6 - **EVOLUTIONARY EXPERIENCE DESIGN (EXD)**:

"You’ve got to start with the customer experience and work backwards to the technology." ~ Steve Jobs

“If you want to teach people a new way of thinking, don't bother trying to teach them. Instead, give them a tool, the use of which will lead to new ways of thinking.” ~ Buckminster Fuller

"People say that what we’re all seeking is a meaning for life. I don’t think that’s what we’re really seeking. I think that what we’re seeking is an experience of being alive, so that our life experiences on the purely physical plane will have resonances with our own innermost being and reality, so that we actually feel the rapture of being alive." 
― Joseph Campbell, The Power of Myth

"Follow your bliss and doors will open where there were no doors before." 
― Joseph Campbell, The Power of Myth

All people on the planet have at least one thing in common: we all want a good experience of being alive (tho there is a diversity to what ‘good experience’ means).  User experience design with a strong leaning toward encouraging conscious evolution.  Principles of gamification as optimal elements of user experience / hard wired in our minds.  Thus, an evolutionary game.  Incentivization as a key evolutionary trend.  PLAY


7 - **TECHNOLOGY CAN BE A MAGIC WAND**:

Humanities relationship with technology has ancient roots, and is inextricably bound with our cultural transformation and conscious evolution.

All technology is a ‘double-edged sword’.  Technology can be yielded for extraordinary benefic creation or malefic destruction.  The choice is up to us (conscious evolution) to choose which way we yield the sword.  

The most magic is on the fringes of innovation and at the confluence of major innovation trends (DLT, AI, VR, BT, etc). 

Enchantment as necessary toward action (enchantment over emergency for necessity to change ((emergency is usually the case, but enchantment can also begin the ‘call’?))).

“The funny thing about games and fictions is that they have a weird way of bleeding into reality. Whatever else it is, the world that humans experience is animated with narratives, rituals, and roles that organize psychological experience, social relations, and our imaginative grasp of the material cosmos. The world, then, is in many ways a webwork of fictions, or, better yet, of stories. The contemporary urge to “gamify” our social and technological interactions is, in this sense, simply an extension of the existing games of subculture, of folklore, even of belief. This is the secret truth of the history of religions: not that religions are “nothing more” than fictions, crafted out of sociobiological need or wielded by evil priests to control ignorant populations, but that human reality possesses an inherently fictional or fantastic dimension whose “game engine” can — and will — be organized along variously visionary, banal, and sinister lines. Part of our obsession with counterfactual genres like sci-fi or fantasy is not that they offer escape from reality — most of these genres are glum or dystopian a lot of the time anyway — but because, in reflecting the “as if” character of the world, they are actually realer than they appear.” ~ Erik Davis, TechGnosis: Myth, Magic Mysticism in the Age of Information


8 - **Balance of Decentralization and Centralization**
--> include in Complexity Science / Theory ?

"When decentralized blockchain protocols start displacing the centralized web services that dominate the current Internet, we'll start to see real internet-based sovereignty. The future Internet will be decentralized." ~ Olaf Carlson-Wee


9 - **MYTHOS LEADS TO ETHOS**: 

Mythos:
a myth or mythology.
- (in literature) a traditional or recurrent narrative theme or plot structure.
- a set of beliefs or assumptions about something.

Quote on mythos and/or ethos?

invitation leads to action. ??? form and function.  Emptiness and form … lead with the tip of the spear

“Myth is not prehistory; it is timeless reality, which repeats itself in history.” ~ Ernst Junger

“When we illuminate the road back to our ancestors, they have a way of reaching out, of manifesting themselves...sometimes even physically.” ~ Raquel Cepeda

“That is not dead which can eternal lie,
And with strange aeons even death may die.” 
~ H.P Lovecraft

"Myth is neither a lie nor a confession: it is an inflexion." 
~ Roland Barthes

"Myth is the hidden part of every story, the buried part, the region that is still unexplored because there are as yet no words to enable us to get there. Myth is nourished by silence as well as by words."
~ Italo Calvino

"He said myths and mythology wasn't to give meaning to life but to give us an experience of life, an experience of vitality in being alive." ~ Joseph Campbell

"It is a myth, not a mandate, a fable not a logic, and symbol rather than a reason by which men are moved."
~ Irwin Edman

"There is nothing truer than myth: history, in its attempt to realize myth, distorts it, stops halfway; when history claims to have succeeded, this is nothing but humbug and mystification. Everything we dream is realizable. Reality does not have to be: it is simply what it is." ~ Eugene Ionesco

"Myth is an attempt to narrate a whole human experience, of which the purpose is too deep, going too deep in the blood and soul, for mental explanation or description." ~ D. H. (David Herbert) Lawrence

"It is a sure sign that a culture has reached a dead end when it is no longer intrigued by its myths." ~ Greil Marcus

"Myths and legends die hard in America. We love them for the extra dimension they provide, the illusion of near-infinite possibility to erase the narrow confines of most men's reality. Weird heroes and mould-breaking champions exist as living proof to those who need it that the tyranny of the rat race is not yet final." ~ Hunter S. Thompson

"Myths which are believed in tend to become true." ~ George Orwell

"Sometimes legends make reality, and become more useful than the facts." ~ Salman Rushdie

"It is a sure sign that a culture has reached a dead end when it is no longer intrigued by its myths." ~ Greil Marcus

"I think that we need mythology. We need a bedrock of story and legend in order to live our lives coherently." ~ Alan Moore

"The dark night of the soul comes just before revelation.  When everything is lost, and all seems darkness, then comes the new life and all that is needed." ~ Joseph Campbell

“The cave you fear to enter holds the treasure you seek.” ~Joseph Campbell

“Such notes as warbled to the string,
Drew iron tears down Pluto’s cheek,
And made Hell grant what Love did seek.”
~ John Milton, “Il Penseroso”

ACTUM
"What’s missing isn’t the ideas ... it’s the will to execute them." ~ Seth Godin

PRAXIS
"praxis is the process by which a theory, lesson, or skill is enacted, embodied, or realized."

10 - **NATURAL LAW / COMMON LAW**:

11 - **COMPLEXITY THEORY / SCIENCE**:

"Complexity theory is becoming a science that recognizes and celebrates the creativity of nature. Now that’s pretty extraordinary, because it opens the door to a new way of seeing the world, recognizing that these complex dynamic systems are sensitive to initial conditions and have emergent properties. We have to learn to walk carefully in relation to these complex systems on which the quality of our lives depends, from microbial ecosystems to the biosphere, because we influence them although we cannot control them. This knowledge is new to our western scientific mentality ..." (Goodwin et al., 2001, p.27).
